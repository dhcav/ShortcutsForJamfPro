# jamfAppSourcer

This Shortcut is designed to simplify determining the optimal packaging workflow for a list of apps by listing availability of the given title/s in the three auto-packaging/distribution utilities listed above. While this is not a common task for most production environments, it is a regular chore for Jamf *partners* such as consultants, MSPs etc supporting our customers.

If a full match is not found, the Shortcut will attempt to match the first word to indicate the need to investigate further. 

This Shortcut is intended to run by itself and does not relate directly to any other Shortcuts.

## Usage Notes
- Requires Jamf Pro version 10.39
- Please use a single column .csv with this Shortcut containing app titles **ONLY**
- Future version will include adding vendor names to commonly used and mis-titled apps (e.g. Photoshop to Adobe Photoshop, Office 365 to Microsoft Office 365) to reduce false negatives 
- Installomator and MAS titles are derived directly from the source on run
- Jamf App Installers and Patch Management titles are not anywhere I can find them to derive programmatically so I‚Äôll update the GitHub .txt file every start of the month after new titles are announced (nbd: I‚Äôve made another Shortcut to automate it as far as possible üòé)
- The Results preview renders somewhat smaller on iPhone and I‚Äôll address this in future version
- As always, please provide feedback if you encounter any issues

## Release Notes
### Version 1.1
*Updated by Damian Cavanagh in August 2023*

Included in this update:
- added Jamf Patch Management as package source (feature request by [@marcusransom](https://github.com/marcusransom))
- added new 'key' section to results preview (two Jamf sources but neither have a logo/icon)
- updated Jamf App Installers and Patch Management list location to [shortcutsForJamfPro/helperFiles](https://github.com/dhcav/ShortcutsForJamfPro/tree/main/helperFiles) (moved from separate repo)
- replaced comprehensive Shortcut notes in comment with basic notes and link to GitHub folder for full info
- resolved error with text replacement when converting .csv results into rich text (will now only replace the result text and not partially replace app name strings with emoji)
- fixed error in which check for 'Partial Match' on Jamf App Installers was operating on incorrect variable and always resulted in Partial match - meaning no app ever received the 'No Match' result for this source
