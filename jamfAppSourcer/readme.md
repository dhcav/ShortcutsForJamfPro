This Shortcut is designed to simplify determining the optimal packaging workflow for a list of apps by listing availability of the given title/s in the three auto-packaging/distribution utilities listed above. While this is not a common task for most production environments, it is a regular chore for Jamf *partners* such as consultants, MSPs etc supporting our customers.

If a full match is not found, the Shortcut will attempt to match the first word to indicate the need to investigate further. 

This Shortcut is intended to run by itself and does not relate directly to any other Shortcuts. 

### How to use: 
#### From Finder/Files (anywhere you can right-click or share the .csv)
1. Right click on .csv file and select Quick Actions (Mac) or tap Share button (mobile)
2. Select this Shortcut
3. View Preview (HTML)
4. Choose format to save/share

#### Standalone (from Shortcuts or Menu Bar):
1. Run the Shortcut
2. Select the .csv file as prompted
3. View Preview (HTML)
4. Choose format to save/share

## Device/OS Compatibility

- iPad:  ‚úÖ (iPadOS 16)
- Mac:   ‚úÖ (macOS 13 Ventura)
- Apple Watch ‚ùå

## Notes
- Requires Jamf Pro version 10.39
- Please use a single column .csv with this Shortcut containing app titles **ONLY**
- Future version will include adding vendor names to commonly used and mis-titled apps (e.g. Photoshop to Adobe Photoshop, Office 365 to Microsoft Office 365) to reduce false negatives 
- Installomator and MAS titles are derived directly from the source on run
- Jamf App Installers titles are not anywhere I can find them to derive programmatically so I‚Äôll update the GitHub .txt file every start of the month after new titles are announced (nbd: I‚Äôve made another Shortcut to automate it as far as possible üòé)
- The Results preview renders somewhat smaller on iPhone and I‚Äôll address this in future version
- As always, please provide feedback if you encounter any issues
